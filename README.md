# Optimizing-Food-Security: Data Mining for Reducing Food Waste in Oxfam's Supply Chain

#Food wastage in retail outlets represents a significant challenge, not only contributing to revenue loss but also impacting global food security and sustainability efforts. Organizations like Oxfam, which are dedicated to alleviating poverty and hunger, face operational inefficiencies that hinder their ability to reduce waste effectively. These inefficiencies arise from factors such as poor inventory management, mismatched supply and demand, and suboptimal product placement strategies. This project seeks to analyze these factors, providing actionable insights to reduce wastage, improve resource allocation, and support Oxfam's mission of creating a sustainable and equitable food distribution system.
