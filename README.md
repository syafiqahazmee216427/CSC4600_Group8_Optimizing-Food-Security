# Optimizing-Food-Security: Data Mining for Reducing Food Waste in Oxfam's Supply Chain

Food wastage in retail outlets represents a significant challenge, not only contributing to revenue loss but also impacting global food security and sustainability efforts. Organizations like Oxfam, which are dedicated to alleviating poverty and hunger, face operational inefficiencies that hinder their ability to reduce waste effectively. These inefficiencies arise from factors such as poor inventory management, mismatched supply and demand, and suboptimal product placement strategies. This project seeks to analyze these factors, providing actionable insights to reduce wastage, improve resource allocation, and support Oxfam's mission of creating a sustainable and equitable food distribution system. 

Objectives;
- Analyze Wastage and Revenue Loss: Identify product types and outlet characteristics that contribute to high levels of food wastage and revenue loss.
- Support Oxfam’s Mission: Provide insights to enhance food distribution strategies, aligning with Oxfam’s goals of reducing hunger and promoting sustainable practices.
- Predict and Forecast Trends: Use data mining techniques to predict the likelihood of product wastage and forecast future trends to guide strategic planning.
- Optimize Inventory Management: Highlight optimization opportunities for inventory and product placement to reduce wastage.
- Enhance Operational Efficiency: Identify underperforming outlets and inefficient processes to implement targeted improvements.
- By achieving these objectives, this project not only addresses the pressing issue of food wastage but also empowers Oxfam to refine its operations, contributing to its overarching goal of fostering sustainable food systems.
